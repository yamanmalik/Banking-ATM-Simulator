This repository contains the files for a banking atm simulator which was a project in one
of my programming classes. The BankGUI code was provided to me for this project, I wrote the code for
the rest of the program to function; checking if account exists, matching account number with account
name, depositing, etc.
 
In order to run the system, run the BankApp.java file.
A first and a last name is required to initalize the account first (Add account)

Deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks can be made. Different rates
depending on if user is a student, adult, senior or senior VIP.
